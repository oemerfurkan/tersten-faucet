# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. And also with a frontend folder where you can insert your frontend. It also sets up all contract informations in the "frontend/src/contracts/Lock.json"

When working with contracts with another names (probably) you need to edit deploy.js and change "Lock, lock"

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
